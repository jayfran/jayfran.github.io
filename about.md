# About Me

I’m a data scientist and recent graduate of a dual degree engineering program between _Oberlin College (BA) & Columbia University (BS)_. My major, _Operations Research: Engineering Management Systems_, has prepared me to be a holistic problem solver with technical expertise in data analytics, visualization, and machine learning (_Python, Excel, SQL, R_).

Some of my work experiences have included consulting, operations, non-profit, finance, and working with youth. I’m passionate about using my skillset to create positive social change in areas like gender equity, LGBTQ+ rights, and youth empowerment!

Some of my hobbies include playing Ultimate Frisbee, reading Science Fiction, and leading Dungeons & Dragons games! I also enjoy using Python to explore how data relates to the things I’m curious about like politics, music, and more (check out my ~ [Projects](./projects) ~).
